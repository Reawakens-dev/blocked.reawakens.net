# blocked.reawakens.net
The website for blocked.reawakens.net.

This website is hosted on Cloudflare pages, any push to "main" in this repo will instantly upload to CFP.

If someone gets/is banned by the Crowdsec IDS/IPS, or the cloudflare filters, they will attempt to redirect them to this website.

While both can do inline blocking, it can get really jank if a real human gets blocked, as it can break caching on there browser, hence this page.

The purpose of this is only to be a block page.

I do want to add some trackers to it, so we can see the riff raff that joins.
